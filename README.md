📄 Project Documentation: Loan Summary Dashboard
🏷️ Project Title:
Financial Loan Performance Dashboard (Built in Excel)

🧠 Business Case / Background:
Financial institutions must continuously track the performance of their loan portfolios to ensure profitability and manage risk. This dashboard was developed to monitor key indicators of loan disbursement, repayment behavior, and regional spread, allowing for smarter decision-making and early identification of defaulters.

🎯 Objectives:
Analyze loan disbursement trends over time

Identify the rate of defaulters vs non-defaulters

Visualize interest rate distribution

Segment loan distribution by region and loan type

Provide actionable KPIs for stakeholders

🔧 Tools & Techniques Used:
Excel

Power Query (for data cleaning and transformation)

Power Pivot (data modeling with relationships)

DAX formulas (for custom KPIs and metrics)

Pivot Tables & Charts (for interactivity)

Slicers (for filtering by region, loan type, year)

📊 Key Metrics & Visuals:
💵 Total Loan Disbursed

❌ Number of Defaulters

✅ Number of Non-Defaulters

📅 Monthly Disbursement Trend (Line Chart)

🌍 Loan Distribution by Region (Map or Bar Chart)

🏷️ Loan Amount by Type (Stacked Column)

📈 Interest Rate Distribution (Histogram or Line)

🔎 Insights Generated:
The South West region had the highest loan disbursement.

Defaulters peaked during Q3, signaling the need for closer follow-up post-disbursement.

Interest rates were relatively higher in loans disbursed to the North Central zone.

The repayment rate improved significantly in the last quarter, likely due to enhanced tracking systems.
